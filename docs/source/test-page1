# MD Test Page
This page tests MD support in base read the docs and shall go over some features that should work in a basic page

Lists like these should work
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

Item 3 in particular is of note so it should be **bold**
Italics should also function in this text. We *shall* try now

Code example
```
Heres some code 
code.sh
test loop () {
  for i in x; do
    echo "hi"
  done
}
```
